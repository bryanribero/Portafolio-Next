            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-10">I am a 5th-year student at the School of Computer Science, with knowledge in programming (Java, JavaScript, C#), databases (SQL, MSQL), web design, computer maintenance and structure, operating systems, networks, and electronics. Throughout my education, I have specialized in web development, particularly in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-10">I completed the 'JÃ³venes a Programar' course at Ceibal and obtained several certifications in .NET, which have strengthened my programming skills. Additionally, I have taken courses on platforms such as Coursera, where I trained in modern technologies like React and Angular. These experiences have allowed me to gain a broader perspective of web development and apply my knowledge in practical projects.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-300">Although I currently specialize in frontend development, my goal is to continue training and expand my knowledge to become a full-stack developer, acquiring skills both on the client-side and in the backend.</p>
